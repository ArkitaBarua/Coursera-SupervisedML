# ### 2.6 Learning parameters using batch gradient descent 
# 
# You will now find the optimal parameters of a linear regression model by using batch gradient descent. Recall batch refers to running all the examples in one iteration.
# - You don't need to implement anything for this part. Simply run the cells below. 
# 
# - A good way to verify that gradient descent is working correctly is to look
# at the value of $J(w,b)$ and check that it is decreasing with each step. 
# 
# - Assuming you have implemented the gradient and computed the cost correctly and you have an appropriate value for the learning rate alpha, $J(w,b)$ should never increase and should converge to a steady value by the end of the algorithm.
