### Exercise 4
# 
# Please complete the `predict` function to produce `1` or `0` predictions given a dataset and a learned parameter vector $w$ and $b$.
# - First you need to compute the prediction from the model $f(x^{(i)}) = g(w \cdot x^{(i)} + b)$ for every example 
#     - You've implemented this before in the parts above
# - We interpret the output of the model ($f(x^{(i)})$) as the probability that $y^{(i)}=1$ given $x^{(i)}$ and parameterized by $w$.
# - Therefore, to get a final prediction ($y^{(i)}=0$ or $y^{(i)}=1$) from the logistic regression model, you can use the following heuristic -
# 
#   if $f(x^{(i)}) >= 0.5$, predict $y^{(i)}=1$
#   
#   if $f(x^{(i)}) < 0.5$, predict $y^{(i)}=0$
#     
# If you get stuck, you can check out the hints presented after the cell below to help you with the implementation.

# ## 3 - Regularized Logistic Regression
# 
# In this part of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. 
# 
# <a name="3.1"></a>
# ### 3.1 Problem Statement
# 
# Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. 
# - From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. 
# - To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.
# 
# <a name="3.2"></a>
# ### 3.2 Loading and visualizing the data
# 
# Similar to previous parts of this exercise, let's start by loading the dataset for this task and visualizing it. 
# 
# - The `load_dataset()` function shown below loads the data into variables `X_train` and `y_train`
#   - `X_train` contains the test results for the microchips from two tests
#   - `y_train` contains the results of the QA  
#       - `y_train = 1` if the microchip was accepted 
#       - `y_train = 0` if the microchip was rejected 
#   - Both `X_train` and `y_train` are numpy arrays.

# In[103]:


# load dataset
X_train, y_train = load_data("data/ex2data2.txt")


# #### View the variables
# 
# The code below prints the first five values of `X_train` and `y_train` and the type of the variables.
# 

# In[104]:


# print X_train
print("X_train:", X_train[:5])
print("Type of X_train:",type(X_train))

# print y_train
print("y_train:", y_train[:5])
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))


# #### Check the dimensions of your variables
# 
# Another useful way to get familiar with your data is to view its dimensions. Let's print the shape of `X_train` and `y_train` and see how many training examples we have in our dataset.

# In[105]:


print ('The shape of X_train is: ' + str(X_train.shape))
print ('The shape of y_train is: ' + str(y_train.shape))
print ('We have m = %d training examples' % (len(y_train)))


# #### Visualize your data
# 
# The helper function `plot_data` (from `utils.py`) is used to generate a figure like Figure 3, where the axes are the two test scores, and the positive (y = 1, accepted) and negative (y = 0, rejected) examples are shown with different markers.
# 
# <img src="images/figure 3.png"  width="450" height="450">

# In[106]:


# Plot examples
plot_data(X_train, y_train[:], pos_label="Accepted", neg_label="Rejected")

# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Microchip Test 2') 
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Microchip Test 1') 
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
plt.show()


# Figure 3 shows that our dataset cannot be separated into positive and negative examples by a straight-line through the plot. Therefore, a straight forward application of logistic regression will not perform well on this dataset since logistic regression will only be able to find a linear decision boundary.
# 

# <a name="3.3"></a>
# ### 3.3 Feature mapping
# 
# One way to fit the data better is to create more features from each data point. In the provided function `map_feature`, we will map the features into all polynomial terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$ up to the sixth power.
# 
# $$\mathrm{map\_feature}(x) = 
# \left[\begin{array}{c}
# x_1\\
# x_2\\
# x_1^2\\
# x_1 x_2\\
# x_2^2\\
# x_1^3\\
# \vdots\\
# x_1 x_2^5\\
# x_2^6\end{array}\right]$$
# 
# As a result of this mapping, our vector of two features (the scores on two QA tests) has been transformed into a 27-dimensional vector. 
# 
# - A logistic regression classifier trained on this higher-dimension feature vector will have a more complex decision boundary and will be nonlinear when drawn in our 2-dimensional plot. 
# - We have provided the `map_feature` function for you in utils.py. 

# In[107]:


print("Original shape of data:", X_train.shape)

mapped_X =  map_feature(X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1])
print("Shape after feature mapping:", mapped_X.shape)


# Let's also print the first elements of `X_train` and `mapped_X` to see the tranformation.

# In[108]:


print("X_train[0]:", X_train[0])
print("mapped X_train[0]:", mapped_X[0])


# While the feature mapping allows us to build a more expressive classifier, it is also more susceptible to overfitting. In the next parts of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to fit the data and also see for yourself how regularization can help combat the overfitting problem.
