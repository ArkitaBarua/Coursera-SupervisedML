# ### Exercise 2
# 
# Please complete the `compute_cost` function.
# Note:
# * As you are doing this, remember that the variables `X_train` and `y_train` are not scalar values but matrices of shape ($m, n$) and ($ùëö$,1) respectively, where  $ùëõ$ is the number of features and $ùëö$ is the number of training examples.
# * You can use the sigmoid function that you implemented above for this part.
#
